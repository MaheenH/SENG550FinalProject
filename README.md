The aim of this project is to develop a robust supervised learning model using regression to predict car prices based on a dataset containing various features, such as car specifications, conditions, and geographic location. The project involves three primary stages: data preprocessing, cleaning and statistical analysis, machine learning model development, and prediction evaluations. The dataset was first cleaned and transformed through handling missing values, detecting and addressing outliers, determining data types for features, and scaling numerical features. Feature engineering and feature selection was employed to remove redundant or irrelevant columns to optimize the model performance and reduce dimensionality, while also encoding categorical features.

In the modeling stage, various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to identify the best performing model. This involved splitting the data into training and test sets, and using an experimental process of trial and error until we determine performance is within an acceptable threshold. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate model effectiveness and our goal during testing was to lower RMSE and MAE results through further engineering. Our final, best performing regression model used Random Forests and demonstrated significant predictive power, offering insights into the key factors that influence vehicle pricing. The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, closely aligning with the prices observed in real world car selling websites. Therefore, this project highlights how effective data preprocessing and rigorous model evaluations can lead to developing data driven solutions for real world problems.
